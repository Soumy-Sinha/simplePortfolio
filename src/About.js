      <p>
      Hi I am Soumy Sinha, a passionate B.Tech student with a strong interest in web development, particularly in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). My journey in the world of technology started with a curiosity to understand how websites work, and it has evolved into a deep passion for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a solid foundation in computer science and software engineering. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects and assignments, where I've honed my programming skills and developed a knack for problem-solving.

The MERN stack, with its robust and versatile technologies, has become my primary focus. I love creating web applications that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience. I am constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest web development trends and best practices.

My goal is to leverage my education and skills to contribute to exciting projects, work with talented teams, and continue exploring the ever-evolving field of web development. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to making a positive impact in the world of technology.
